<h1>Testing Project for Opensky.com</h1>

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application

Application under test: **https://opensky.com/**

Tools used: Jira, Zephyr Squad, Google Slides.

**<h2>Functional specifications:</h2>**

The below story's was created in Jira and describes the functional specifications of the "Caracteristics, Constraints and Checkout flow for a user " module's, for which the final project is performed upon.

**<h2>Testing process</h2>**

The test process was performed based on the standard test process as described below.

**<h3>1.1 Test planning</h3>**

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for all the modules from the OpenSky.com application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan. The test plan that was created for this project can be found here **https://bit.ly/4bV0Fvy**

**<h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>**

The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

**<h3>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control<h3>**
In this phase, the project is monitored and controlled to ensure that it is delivered according to plan. The project team will monitor performance, budget and delivery timelines, identifying issues and risks and implementing corrective actions if necessary.

**Test monitoring:**

Monitoring is the process of evaluating test activities and efforts.
The goal is to track the current progress of testing activity, find and track relevant metrics, estimate future actions based on those metrics, and provide feedback to the team.
To monitor effectively, we follow these steps:

<li>Create a monitoring plan.</li>
<li>Updates the progress log.</li>
<li>Analyze the recording and make adjustments.</li>
<li>Produce a report.</li>
<br></br>

**Test control:**

After monitoring, we enter the control phase of the test.
<li>Here, we prioritize testing activities, review the testing schedule, and make other changes to improve the quality and efficiency of the future testing process.</li>
<li>Control is a feedback loop that helps us keep the project on the tracks.</li>
<br></br>

<h3> 1.3 Test Analysis </h3>
Teste Analysis is a process of checking and analyzing documentation from the client to establish test conditions. A proactive approach would consist of suggestions for improvement on the requirements and the defects found being able to be fixed much easier and cheaper.
<br><br>

The following test conditions were found: <br>

<h3>1.4 Test Design</h3>

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad based on the analysis of the specifications. The test cases can be accessed here : https://bit.ly/4bXhHsL

<h3>1.5 Test Implementation</h3>

In this phase of software testing for the web site OpenSky, several elements are evaluated to ensure product quality and functionality. Here are some of them:

**1.5.1 Introduction:**

<li>The objective of this testing is to ensure that the web application meets the requirements and is free of defects.</li>
<li>This testing plan is for the Web Application OpenSky.com , version 1.4.1.</li>
<li>Build Number: 101</li><br>

**1.5.2 Test Environment:**
<li>Operating System: Windows 10; 11, MacOS</li>
<li>Browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari</li>
<li>Hardware: Intel i5 processor, 8GB RAM</li><br>

**1.5.3 Test Approach:**
<li>Manual testing will be used to test all the functionalities of the web application</li>
<li>Responsive testing will be done to ensure the web application is compatible with different devices and screen sizes</li><br>

<h3>1.6. Test Execution </h3>

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: **Open_Sky_improvements_Cycle_Summary**

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: 
<li>https://github.com/OctavianGriga/Octavian-Griga/blob/main/GOTT-20.pdf</li>
<li>https://github.com/OctavianGriga/Octavian-Griga/blob/main/GOTT-25.pdf</li>
<li>https://github.com/OctavianGriga/Octavian-Griga/blob/main/GOTT-26.pdf</li><br>

The following is a summary of the bugs that have been found:
<li>Wrong woman item in mens serching criteria - Low priority-Minor Severity.</li>
<li>Item for men have different price in basket that in search - Low priority-Minor Severity.</li>
<li>Item have different price in basket that in serch - Low priority-Minor Severity.</li><br>

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.

<h3>1.7 Test Completion
